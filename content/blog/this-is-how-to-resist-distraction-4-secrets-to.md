«Here’s how to resist distraction and be less reactive:

Control your context: You can’t react to what’s not there.


Stay calm: Stress makes you dumb. Stress and reacting leads to dumb behavior.


Think about your goals: Get Stoicism, mindfulness and dopamine on your side.


Make a deliberate decision: When you do, your brain is better able to resist no-no’s.»<br/><br/><b>This Is How To Resist Distraction: 4 Secrets To Remarkable Focus</b><br/><br/>
