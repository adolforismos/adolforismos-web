«The first effective feedback system is measurement. The things we measure are the things we improve. This holds true for the number of pages we read, the number of pushups we do, the number of sales calls we make, and any other task that is important to us. It is only through measurement that we have any proof of whether we are getting better or worse.»<br/><br/><b>The Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Deliberate Practice</b><br/><br/>
