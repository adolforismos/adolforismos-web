<blockquote>I’m thinking about maybe a mindfulness camp for children. One exercise might be to take a group of 20 kids and keep dividing them into subsets—male/female, younger/older, dark hair/light hair, wearing black/not wearing black—until they realize that everyone is unique. As I’ve said for 30 years, the best way to decrease prejudice is to increase discrimination.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://hbr.org/2014/03/mindfulness-in-the-age-of-complexity/ar/1##I%E2%80%99m+thinking+about+maybe+a+mindfulness+camp+for+children.+One+exercise+might+be+to+take+a+group+of+20+kids+and+keep+dividing+them+into+subsets%E2%80%94male%2Ffemale%2C+younger%2Folder%2C+dark+hair%2Flight+hair%2C+wearing+black%2Fnot+wearing+black%E2%80%94until+they+realize+that+everyone+is+unique.+As+I%E2%80%99ve+said+for+30+years%2C+the+best+way+to+decrease+prejudice+is+to+increase+discrimination." target="_blank">Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity</a>
