I hope that young Aspies, informed by recent literature on the subject, will find the world somewhat less challenging than I have.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/20/parallel-play##I+apply+Romain+Rolland%E2%80%99s+practical+credo%E2%80%94%E2%80%9Cpessimism+of+the+intelligence%3B+optimism+of+the+will%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94to+my+aspirations%2C+but+I+cannot+pretend+that+Asperger%E2%80%99s+has+not+made+much+of+my+existence+miserable+and+isolated+%28how+will+I+get+to+sleep+tonight%3F%29.+I+hope+that+young+Aspies%2C+informed+by+recent+literature+on+the+subject%2C+will+find+the+world+somewhat+less+challenging+than+I+have." target="_blank">Parallel Play - The New Yorker</a>
