<blockquote>A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation.

To himself, he always appears to be doing both.‚Äù&rdquo; via Instapaper <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/5-rules-for-a-vacation-thats-truly-worth-it" target="_blank">https://hbr.org/2015/06/5-rules-for-a-vacation-thats-truly-worth-it</a></blockquote>&#8212;<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/5-rules-for-a-vacation-thats-truly-worth-it" target="_blank">https://hbr.org/2015/06/5-rules-for-a-vacation-thats-truly-worth-it</a>
