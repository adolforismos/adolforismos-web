<blockquote>Mindfulness is the process of actively noticing new things. When you do that, it puts you in the present. It makes you more sensitive to context and perspective. It’s the essence of engagement. And it’s energy-begetting, not energy-consuming. The mistake most people make is to assume it’s stressful and exhausting—all this thinking. But what’s stressful is all the mindless negative evaluations we make and the worry that we’ll find problems and not be able to solve them.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://hbr.org/2014/03/mindfulness-in-the-age-of-complexity/ar/1##Mindfulness+is+the+process+of+actively+noticing+new+things.+When+you+do+that%2C+it+puts+you+in+the+present.+It+makes+you+more+sensitive+to+context+and+perspective.+It%E2%80%99s+the+essence+of+engagement.+And+it%E2%80%99s+energy-begetting%2C+not+energy-consuming.+The+mistake+most+people+make+is+to+assume+it%E2%80%99s+stressful+and+exhausting%E2%80%94all+this+thinking.+But+what%E2%80%99s+stressful+is+all+the+mindless+negative+evaluations+we+make+and+the+worry+that+we%E2%80%99ll+find+problems+and+not+be+able+to+solve+them." target="_blank">Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity</a>
