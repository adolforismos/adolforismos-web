«Nietzsche, who was the first philosopher to use a typewriter, famously wrote “Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts,” which media theorist Friedrich Kittler analyzes in his book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter (p. 200):

“Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts,” Nietzsche wrote. “Technology is entrenched in our history, “ Heidegger said. But the one [Nietzsche] wrote the sentence about the typewriter on a typewriter, the other [Heidegger] described (in a magnificent old German hand) typewriters per se. That is why it was Nietzsche who initiated the transvaluation of all values with his philosophically scandalous sentence about media technology. In 1882, human beings, their thoughts, and their authorship respectively were replaced by two sexes, the text, and blind writing equipment. As the first mechanized philosopher, Nietzsche was also the last. Typescript, according to Klapheck’s painting, was called The Will to Power.»<br/><br/><b>Adventures in Narrated Reality</b><br/><br/>
