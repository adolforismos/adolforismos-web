<blockquote>&ldquo;According to the Intense World Theory, autists could actually be seeing much deeper into the minds, thoughts and emotions of themselves and others, which triggers active avoidance and lock down behaviors. It also requires the ability to simulate others as if you where them and to extrapolate to where their thoughts and behaviors are leading them. Seeing into the minds of others can be extremely disturbing.&rdquo; via Instapaper <a href="http://wrongplanet.net/interview-henry-and-kamila-markram-about-the-intense-world-theory-for-autism/" target="_blank">http://wrongplanet.net/interview-henry-and-kamila-markram-about-the-intense-world-theory-for-autism/</a></blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://wrongplanet.net/interview-henry-and-kamila-markram-about-the-intense-world-theory-for-autism/" target="_blank">http://wrongplanet.net/interview-henry-and-kamila-markram-about-the-intense-world-theory-for-autism/</a>
