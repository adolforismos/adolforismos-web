«Here’s how to use rituals to improve your life:

Savoring Ritual: Make the good times better by having something you do to focus on the good things. Share good news with a partner or have a regular mealtime with your family.


Grief Ritual: When something has you down, write about your feelings. It’ll reduce the pain and help you cope.


Personal Starting Ritual: Beat anxiety and procrastination by having a fun ritual that says it’s time to get to work.


Peak Performance Ritual: If it makes you feel lucky, you will be lucky. Rituals increase confidence and performance.»<br/><br/><b>This Is the No. 1 Ritual You Need to Do Every Day</b><br/><br/>
