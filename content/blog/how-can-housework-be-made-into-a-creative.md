<blockquote>&ldquo;How can housework be made into a creative activity?

The minute we apply a glimmer of consciousness to a mechanical gesture, or practice phenomenology while polishing a piece of old furniture, we sense new impressions come into being beneath this familiar domestic duty. For consciousness rejuvenates everything, giving a quality of beginning to the most everyday actions.&rdquo; via Instapaper <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/01/gaston-bachelard-the-poetics-of-space-housework/" target="_blank">http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/01/gaston-bachelard-the-poetics-of-space-housework/</a></blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/01/gaston-bachelard-the-poetics-of-space-housework/" target="_blank">http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/01/gaston-bachelard-the-poetics-of-space-housework/</a>
