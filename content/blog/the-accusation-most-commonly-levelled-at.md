<blockquote>The accusation most commonly levelled at humanitarians is that their efforts can often be more about the saviour than the saved. There is no doubt about the nobility of their goals: an end to suffering and war. But though humanitarians like to say they champion universal human values, it’s probably more accurate to say they advocate the spread of enlightenment, as it is understood in the West. Naturally, that presupposes that other parts of the world, and their ­peoples, are less progressive.­

The Responsibility to Protect wrote in stone that some governments are better than others. In that sense, R2P embodies the same instincts as the kinder aspects of colonialism. Like imperialism, the foundation of humanitarianism is that the West knows best. Like imperialism, humanitarianism overrules others’ sovereignty in the name of civilising them. Like imperialists, humanitarians often find themselves in opposition to doctrinaire Islam, whose prescriptions for women and criminals they find hideously backward. And what they present as selflessness can often feel like self-regard on the receiving end.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/10/george-clooney-south-sudan-how-worlds-newest-nation-imploded-274547.html##The+accusation+most+commonly+levelled+at+humanitarians+is+that+their+efforts+can+often+be+more+about+the+saviour+than+the+saved.+There+is+no+doubt+about+the+nobility+of+their+goals%3A+an+end+to+suffering+and+war.+But+though+humanitarians+like+to+say+they+champion+universal+human+values%2C+it%E2%80%99s+probably+more+accurate+to+say+they+advocate+the+spread+of+enlightenment%2C+as+it+is+understood+in+the+West.+Naturally%2C+that+presupposes+that+other+parts+of+the+world%2C+and+their+%C2%ADpeoples%2C+are+less+progressive.%C2%AD+The+Responsibility+to+Protect+wrote+in+stone+that+some+governments+are+better+than+others.+In+that+sense%2C+R2P+embodies+the+same+instincts+as+the+kinder+aspects+of+colonialism.+Like+imperialism%2C+the+foundation+of+humanitarianism+is+that+the+West+knows+best.+Like+imperialism%2C+humanitarianism+overrules+others%E2%80%99+sovereignty+in+the+name+of+civilising+them.+Like+imperialists%2C+humanitarians+often+find+themselves+in+opposition+to+doctrinaire+Islam%2C+whose+prescriptions+for+women+and+criminals+they+find+hideously+backward.+And+what+they+present+as+selflessness+can+often+feel+like+self-regard+on+the+receiving+end." target="_blank">George Clooney, South Sudan and How the World&rsquo;s Newest Nation Imploded</a>
