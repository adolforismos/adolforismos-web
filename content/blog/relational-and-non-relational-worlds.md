From the way our mind sees the reality, in a general and regular day, one depends on relations and comparisons; and in a liberated mind the relations disappear.

The Self is constructed in the relational world. On fact, the world is constructed because the relations the mind perceives. It's a web of conditions and dependencies. It's the samsara.

When we are aware and mindfulness of the relational world, including the Self, another self (without the capital "s"), an inner self (o the no-self behind the layers of the onion called Self), reaches the nirvana, the non relational world.
