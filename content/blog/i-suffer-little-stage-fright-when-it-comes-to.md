<blockquote>I suffer little stage fright when it comes to public speaking or appearances on radio or television, but I continue to find unstructured participation in small social gatherings agonizing. It would be easier for me to improvise an epic poem at a sold-out Yankee Stadium than to approach an attractive stranger across the room and strike up a conversation.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/20/parallel-play##I+suffer+little+stage+fright+when+it+comes+to+public+speaking+or+appearances+on+radio+or+television%2C+but+I+continue+to+find+unstructured+participation+in+small+social+gatherings+agonizing.+It+would+be+easier+for+me+to+improvise+an+epic+poem+at+a+sold-out+Yankee+Stadium+than+to+approach+an+attractive+stranger+across+the+room+and+strike+up+a+conversation." target="_blank">Parallel Play - The New Yorker</a>
